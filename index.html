      <p class="about">
        Adobe Flash Player (known in Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Google
        Chrome as Shockwave Flash) is computer software for content created on
        the Adobe Flash platform. Flash Player is capable of viewing multimedia
        contents, executing rich Internet applications, and streaming audio and
        video. In addition, Flash Player can run from a web browser as a browser
        plug-in or on supported mobile devices. Flash Player was created by
        Macromedia and has been developed and distributed by Adobe Systems since
        Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005. Flash Player is distributed as
        freeware. With the exception of the China-specific and enterprise
        supported variants, Flash Player was discontinued on December 31, 2020.
        Since January 12, 2021, Flash Player versions newer than 32.0.0.371
        refuse to play Flash content and instead display a static warning
        message.

        Flash Player runs SWF files that can be created by Adobe Flash
        Professional, Adobe Flash Builder or by third-party tools such as
        FlashDevelop. Flash Player supports vector graphics, 3D graphics,
        embedded audio, video and raster graphics, and a scripting language
        called ActionScript. ActionScript is based on ECMAScript (similar to
        JavaScript) and supports object-oriented code. Google Chrome, Internet
        Explorer 11, in Windows 8 and later, and Microsoft Edge came bundled
        with a sandboxed Adobe Flash plug-in.

        Flash Player once had a large user base, and was a common format for web
        games, animations, and graphical user interface (GUI) elements embedded
        in web pages. However, the most popular use of Flash among the 10-20 age
        group was for Flash games. Adobe stated in 2013 that more than 400
        million out of over 1 billion connected desktops update to the new
        version of Flash Player within six weeks of release.However, Flash
        Player has become increasingly criticized for its performance,
        consumption of battery on mobile devices, the number of security
        vulnerabilities that had been discovered in the software, and its closed
        platform nature. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was highly critical of
        Flash Player, having published an open letter detailing Apple's
        reasoning for not supporting Flash on its iOS device family. Its usage
        has also waned because of modern web standards that allow some of
        Flash's use cases to be fulfilled without third-party plugins.
